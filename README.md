# oscillator
Feel free to use these mathematica files that solve non-linear oscillator differential equations.  I do not promise anything with these files and the onus is on you to check their correctness for your application.

Note 29/07/2016:

duffing_rp_v5.nb is a much more refined duffing oscillator simulation. It allows for clarity in multimode forcing, and the use of recurrence plots in quantifying the multimode forcing and their dissipation for a non zero damping term (when introduced into duffing osci equation).
